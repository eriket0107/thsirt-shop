## This Project is made by me: Erik 

<p>
  The main goal of this project is to practice NextJS 13 with the app directory folder and challenge myself to learn more tricks about React and its environment. Additionally, I used this project as an opportunity to learn and implement Tailwind CSS, exploring its powerful utility-first approach for styling. This repository will serve as a learning and practice space, where I can share my progress and knowledge gained during the process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
